This is an e-learning site. Two kinds of users can login-admin and students. Students can also register whereas admin can only register through database.

Upon log in, a student can visit his/her profile. In the profile, a user can check out his/her courses, give feedback and change password. By clicking on courses one will be able to see all the courses available. One can enroll by paying through the payment gateway. Through the payment status one can check the details of payment.

Similarly by logging in as admin one is directed to admin Dashboard. Here the CRUD operations relating to courses, lessons, students etc can be done. The dashboard has a total of three boxes showing courses, students and sales.
